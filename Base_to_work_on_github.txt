First, you need to install on your PC git.

For that, go to https://gitforwindows.org/ and download git by button Download.

After that, you'll be have to initial your git repositories. 
I recomended you create directory by this command:

//open git Bash

write: "cd Documents" (This command go you to Documets);

write: "mkdir Git_Sergo-Mergo" (This command create new directory with name "Git_Sergo-Mergo" on your PC);

write "cd Git_Sergo-mergo";


Now, when your create you local directory, it's good time to clone our repositories to your PC. For do that you need to do:

write: "git clone https://github.com/Sergo-Mergo/antonvarlamovkrytoichyvak.git"



After you do all this instruction, you will have git repository. You can start to work with GitHub.

In this version of that file i'll demostrate pluses of version control on gitHub.
